env:
  SHORT_DOMAIN_HOST: shlink.io  # The custom short domain used for this shlink instance. For example doma.in.
  INVALID_SHORT_URL_REDIRECT_TO: null  # If a URL is provided here, when a user tries to access an invalid short URL, he/she will be redirected to this value. If this env var is not provided, the user will see a generic 404 - not found page.
  BASE_URL_REDIRECT_TO: null  # If a URL is provided here, when a user tries to access Shlink's base URL, he/she will be redirected to this value. If this env var is not provided, the user will see a generic 404 - not found page.
  ANONYMIZE_REMOTE_ADDR: false  # Tells if IP addresses from visitors should be obfuscated before storing them in the database.
  # DISABLE_TRACK_PARAM: The name of a query param that can be used to visit short URLs avoiding the visit to be tracked. This feature won't be available if not value is provided.
  # DELETE_SHORT_URL_THRESHOLD: The amount of visits on short URLs which will not allow them to be deleted. Defaults to 15.
  # VALIDATE_URLS: Boolean which tells if shlink should validate a status 20x is returned (after following redirects) when trying to shorten a URL. Defaults to false.
  # REGULAR_404_REDIRECT_TO: If a URL is provided here, when a user tries to access a URL not matching any one supported by the router, he/she will be redirected to this value. If this env var is not provided, the user will see a generic 404 - not found page.
  # BASE_PATH: The base path from which you plan to serve shlink, in case you don't want to serve it from the root of the domain. Defaults to ''.
  # WEB_WORKER_NUM: The amount of concurrent http requests this shlink instance will be able to server. Defaults to 16.
  # TASK_WORKER_NUM: The amount of concurrent background tasks this shlink instance will be able to execute. Defaults to 16.
  # VISITS_WEBHOOKS: A comma-separated list of URLs that will receive a POST request when a short URL receives a visit.
  # DEFAULT_SHORT_CODES_LENGTH: The length you want generated short codes to have. It defaults to 5 and has to be at least 4, so any value smaller than that will fall back to 4.
